1	About this document
-----------------------
Author: Marzo Sette Torres Junior
e-mail: marzojr@yahoo.com
version: 0.10.03

	This mod is all about new avatars. There are 14 new portraits all told, all
	in the SI style, which REPLACE the old portraits. The portraits usually come
	in male	and female pairs; there are portraits for brunette avatars, blonde
	avatars, black-haired avatars, redheaded avatars, asian avatars and black
	avatars, all with matching paperdolls and sprites -- and there are also
	gumps for paperdoll-less BG. There is also a bucket-headed avatar, for comic
	effect and for those that like U8 or even (*shudder*) U9.
	
	All the portraits -- except for the buckethead avatars -- are based on real
	people -- you can see the full list in the 'Who_is_who.txt' file.
	
	As you can see if you poke around enough, there *are* BG-style versions of
	the portraits. I chose not to use them because they look *awful* with the
	SuperSAI 2x scaler. Also, because the bigger portraits are so much cooler
	than those small portraits could ever hope to be ;-)

2	Installing the mod
----------------------
	This mod is will *not* work in Exult 1.2, nor it will work on any but *the*
	latest snapshots. As of the initial writing of this document (GMT 03:46 AM
	of 20007-03-18), you would likely have to wait ~24 hours just so you could
	download a snapshot	with which it would work!
	
	Also, this mod works for either BG *or* SI, with or without the add-ons.
	It is designed to work in BG even if you don't have SI.

	With those out of the way: to install the mod, unzip it anywhere and copy
	the contents of the 'data' dir it creates to your 'patch' dir. If the folder
	is not there, simply create an empty folder called 'patch' in your BG or SI
	dir and proceed as above. You can use it with BG or SI, your choice.
	
	OPTIONAL: If you want the avatar bodies to behave like normal bodies, you
	will also have to copy a few more files. This isn't required -- you will
	not normally see the dead bodies of the avatar -- but the data is there if
	you want to. You will simply have to copy the contents of the 'data-bg' *or*
	'data-si' (depending on the game you are using) to the same 'patch' dir
	mentioned above.

	You do NOT have to start a new game to see the benefits of this pack! Just
	be sure that cheats are enabled and cycle through the skins with Alt+S or
	change your gender with Ctrl+G (or do both).
	
	***** Using this mod with another mod: If the other mod is the Keyring mod,
	      simply download the latest version of the Keyring mod as it is included
	      in it. For SI Fixes, follow the installation instructions above but
	      with SI Fixes' 'data' dir as your copy target instead. For other mods,
	      you'll have to pester the mod maker to include it :-)
	      
	OPTIONAL: If you want to see how awful the BG-style portraits really are,
	copy the 'bgfaces/faces.vga' file to your patch dir after you install the
	mod normally. This is not possible for the Keyring mod, but you can see it
	in the normal BG game (or in SI, if you prefer).

3	Contributing to this mod
----------------------------
	If you have any suggestions of new portraits (or have done some of them
	yourself!) that you would like to see included in this mod then, by all means,
	please send them to me! You can either e-mail them to me or you can post
	them in the Exult Phorum.

4	Using it in your own mods
-----------------------------
	You are free to use anything I have written in your own mods;
	I ask only that you give me proper credit -- and maybe tell me
	about the mod you are doing, as I might be interested enough to
	help and/or to include as a part of this mod.

	Also, you should include the 'Who_is_who.txt' file in your mod.

5	What this mod does
----------------------
	I thought I said that above already?

	Huh... this is a GRAPHIC package. Spoilers?????
