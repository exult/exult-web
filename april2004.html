							<td>Ultima VII, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following.
								But, being a DOS game with a very non-standard memory manager, it
								is difficult to run it on the latest computers. <i>Exult</i> is a
								project to create an Ultima VII game engine that runs on modern
								operating systems, capable of using the data and graphics files
								that come with the game.

					<h3>
						Code Stolen!
					</h3>
					<p>Someone has hacked into the servers of the Exult team and has
						stolen the sources of Exult. When asked for a reaction, the Exult
						development team said they were shocked that someone would take advantage
						of their years of hard work like this. Several of the programmers are
						reported to have quit working on Exult because of this.
						As a consequence, the upcoming release of Exult version 1.2
						has been delayed at least six months. Willem Jan Palenstijn,
						Exult developer, commented: &quot;I never would have expected
						somebody to do anything like
						this. I always thought the community around Exult was a
						great one; this experience really taught me something about
						human nature. It still feels like a really bad joke to me.&quot;
					</p>
					<p>The Exult team has contacted the authorities and is working with them
						to trace the perpetrator.
						The prime suspect of this theft is James Brown, who is known online using
						the hacker alias &quot;Ender&quot;. He is rumoured to have accessed
						the source on a regular basis over the last several years, only to make
						his move earlier today. It has come to our attention that
						&quot;Ender&quot; may have close ties to a rogue development team of
						which we have no details other than that it is called &quot;Cabal&quot;.
						Most likely this individual did not work alone and certain Exult
						programmers may be facing expulsion from the team as a result of this.
					</p>
					<p>Exult users should be warned that because of the intrusion,
						the latest version of Exult (1.1.10rc2) may have been compromised and
						could contain trojans. The Exult team is in the process of verifying
						the integrity of the latest release.
					</p>
					<p>If you have any evidence that may help us resolve this incident, please
						contact the Exult team at
						<a href="mailto:exult-general@lists.sourceforge.net">exult-general@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
