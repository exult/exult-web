		Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following.
		But, being a DOS game with a very non-standard memory manager, it
		is difficult to run it on the latest computers. <i>Exult</i> is a
		project to create an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern
		operating systems, capable of using the data and graphics files
		that come with the game.

		<h3>Code Stolen!</h3>
		<p>
		Someone has hacked into the servers of the Exult team and has
		stolen the sources of Exult. When asked for a reaction, the Exult
		development team said they were shocked that someone would take advantage
		of their years of hard work like this. Several of the programmers are
		reported to have quit working on Exult because of this.
		As a consequence, the upcoming release of Exult version 1.2
		has been delayed at least six months. Willem Jan Palenstijn,
		Exult developer, commented: &quot;I never would have expected
		somebody to do anything like
		this. I always thought the community around Exult was a 
		great one; this experience really taught me something about
		human nature. It still feels like a really bad joke to me.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
		The Exult team has contacted the authorities and is working with them
		to trace the perpetrator.
		The prime suspect of this theft is James Brown, who is known online using
		the hacker alias &quot;Ender&quot;. He is rumoured to have accessed
		the source on a regular basis over the last several years, only to make
		his move earlier today. It has come to our attention that
		&quot;Ender&quot; may have close ties to a rogue development team of
		which we have no details other than that it is called &quot;Cabal&quot;.
		Most likely this individual did not work alone and certain Exult
		programmers may be facing expulsion from the team as a result of this.
		</p>
		<p>Exult users should be warned that because of the intrusion,
		the latest version of Exult (1.1.10rc2) may have been compromised and
		could contain trojans. The Exult team is in the process of verifying
		the integrity of the latest release.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you have any evidence that may help us resolve this incident, please
		contact the Exult team at
		<a href="mailto:exult-general@lists.sourceforge.net">exult-general@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
