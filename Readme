Quick and dirty guide to our Web-CVS
====================================

- checkout our repository in CVS called "web".

- change/add stuff there 

- commit changes to CVS

- ssh into our webspace (/home/groups/e/ex/exult/htdocs)

- execute "cvs update" (updates /home/groups/e/ex/exult/htdocs with CVS version)

- execute "./update.sh" (gives the right permissions to everyone)
