<p><b>24 October 2002</p></b>
Allthough news are a little slow at the moment we are still alive!
<ul>
<li>Jeffrey Hoeksma wrote an in depth guide on how to use Exult Studio and Dominus merged it with
the existing documentation. Even though it is still not a complete guide it is already quite
useful and a good informative read. Thanks Jeffrey!
<li>We added a letter page that contains some of the praise we received from users and Lord British himself.
<li>Dr.Code fixed some bugs in Exult (selling baked bread, another trial bug in SI) and Exult Studio.
</ul>
<p><b>11 September 2002</p></b>
Development is proceeding quite slowly, but we're still fixing bugs.
Remember some of the things mentioned here are happening on the development 1.1 branch
whereas the 1.0 is only for bugfixes.
<ul>
<li>More progress on the Zaurus port (MIDI support, also thanks to Colourless' port of the FMOPL driver)
<li>Weather shows when gumps are open
<li>Bug fixes
</ul>
<p><b>19 August 2002</p></b>
Artaxerxes is making a lot of progress with the Zaurus port. The latest version supports sound!
<ul>
<li>Explosions inside containers should now properly work
<li>Fixes to sleeping (you should now lie down in the right bed)
<li>Various combat-related bugfixes (slimes, party-members not attacking)
<li>Some cosmetic fixes to conversations
</ul>
<p><b>28 July 2002</p></b>
Artaxerxes is currently porting Exult to the Zaurus! Take a look at the
<A HREF="screenshots_zaurus.php">screenshots</A>. You can also download the current version of the page
from our <A HREF="download.php">download page</A> (under 1.1.x snapshots)
<ul>
<li>Fixed a pathfinding bug in Windows and MacOS that caused trouble with finding paths across staircases. (e.g., Training in Monitor)
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the camera to lose the avatar when going through moongates
<li>Several other bugfixes
</ul>
<p><b>20 July 2002</p></b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the bug that broke moongates in the Sphere generator (BG)
<li>Added some more new BG paperdoll art (Thanks sb-x)
<li>Some fixes to cart-handling
<li>Serpent Isle has been fully played through with the current 1.0.x snapshots, resulting in a lot of SI bugfixes.
</ul>
<p><b>7 July 2002</p></b>
We've been fixing lots of bugs in the 1.0.x snapshots the last month:
<ul>
<li>Fixed several combat-related bugs
<li>Finished adding special object names for Serpent Isle
<li>The --buildmap command line option is working again
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur whenever you're near Spektran (SI)
<li>People should no longer sleep next to their beds or sit next to their chairs
<li>Some fixes to paperdolls in BG, and some new art by Oblivious.
<li>Lots of other minor (and not-so-minor) bugfixes
</ul>
<p><b>10 June 2002</p></b>
<p>
If you checked our download page recently, you may have noticed that
we have two sets of development snapshots now: a 1.0.x (stable)
snapshot, and a 1.1.x (unstable) snapshot.
</p><p>
The 1.0.x branch will become our 1.0 release soon, hopefully, and we
will mainly be fixing any remaining bugs in this branch. We recommend
using the 1.0.x snapshots for playing and testing Exult.
</p><p>
The 1.1.x branch is meant mostly as a 'developer playground' at the
moment. We are making some very destabilizing changes to this branch,
like a rewritten usecode interpreter and new audio code. We do not
recommend using the 1.1.x snapshots for normal playing.

Exult Studio
</ul>
<p><b>2001-05-23</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The 'protect' combat mode is now supported
<li>Jeff fixed a crash during resurrection
<li>The MIDI SFX have been disabled because they didn't sound well.
Read the <a href="faq.php">FAQ</a> for instructions on how to
install the digital SFX packs. (Which sound a lot better :-) )
<li>Fixed several minor and less minor bugs.
</ul>
<p><b>2001-05-16</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Jeff fixed the bug causing the Guardian to sound like a chipmunk
on some systems.
<li>You can now also take screenshot with ctrl-alt-s while menus
(such as the new savegame interface) are open
<li>Marc Winterrowd wrote some documentation for expack. Thanks!
</ul>
Exult alpha 3 was reviewed by the German game magazine GameStar in
the june 2001 issue! Translation from German (by Alexander Wetzlmaier):
<blockquote>
Ultima 7 still belongs to the best role-playing games. It's because
of the many interaction possibilities and its epic story. However,
as a DOS program with a very exotic memory manager and missing
speed adustment, the game doesn't run on modern PCs. Fans are now
working on a new game engine for Windows. In the current Alpha 3
version the first part, The Black Gate, already runs better than in
the original because many bugs were removed. Warren Spector's
Ultima 7: Serpent Isle still causes the programmers problems,
though.
</blockquote>
They rated it 1.8 on a scale from 1 (best) to 5 (worst)!
<p><b>2001-05-10</b></p>
<ul>
<li>lots and lots of bugs fixes, including resurrection, object
names, caltrops, fields and several Forge of Virtue and Silver
Seed bugs
<li>Jeff is working on the interaction between Exult Studio and
Exult (Linux only for now). For instance, entering map-editor mode
will now automatically launch Exult Studio if possible.
<li>Fixed a cross-platform bug in the new savegame info. Old
savegames on some platforms will show wrong information. (The game
itself isn't damaged)
<li>Pressing 1-8 will now open the inventory of your party members.
(Thanks to Telemachos)
</ul>
<p><b>2001-05-01</b></p>

<li>A few scaling (screenshots, fullscreen, resizing) bugs have been

<p><b>2001-04-15</b></p>

You can download a set of SFX (by Joseph Morris) from the <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2335">Exult download page</a> on Sourceforge (jmsfx.zip). Unzip this file to get jmsfx.flx. Then, you need to add the following entry to your exult.cfg, in the config/disk/game/blackgate/ section:
<pre>
&lt;waves&gt;
/path/to/jmsfx.flx
&lt;/waves&gt;</pre>
(replace /path/to/jmsfx.flx with the path to jmsfx.flx, for example ~/exult/jmsfx.flx or c:\exult\jmsfx.flx)
