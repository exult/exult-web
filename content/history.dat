Exult alpha 3 was reviewed by the German game magazine GameStar in
the june 2001 issue! Translation from German (by Alexander Wetzlmaier):
<blockquote>
Ultima 7 still belongs to the best role-playing games. It's because
of the many interaction possibilities and its epic story. However, 
as a DOS program with a very exotic memory manager and missing
speed adustment, the game doesn't run on modern PCs. Fans are now
working on a new game engine for Windows. In the current Alpha 3
version the first part, The Black Gate, already runs better than in
the original because many bugs were removed. Warren Spector's
Ultima 7: Serpent Isle still causes the programmers problems,
though.
</blockquote>
They rated it 1.8 on a scale from 1 (best) to 5 (worst)!
<p><b>2001-05-10</b></p>

<li>lots and lots of bugs fixes, including resurrection, object
names, caltrops, fields and several Forge of Virtue and Silver 
Seed bugs
<li>Jeff is working on the interaction between Exult Studio and
Exult (Linux only for now). For instance, entering map-editor mode
will now automatically launch Exult Studio if possible.
<li>Fixed a cross-platform bug in the new savegame info. Old 
savegames on some platforms will show wrong information. (The game	
itself isn't damaged)
<li>Pressing 1-8 will now open the inventory of your party members.
(Thanks to Telemachos)
