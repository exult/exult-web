		As computers evolve, we risk losing classic computer games from
		the not-so-distant past.  One of these, Ultima 7, an RPG from the
		early 1990's, still has a huge following, and many consider it to
		be one of the most immersive games ever produced.  <i>Exult</i> is a
		project to create an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern
		operating systems, capable of using the data and graphics files
		that come with the game.
