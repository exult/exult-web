		Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following.
		But, being a DOS game with a very non-standard memory manager, it
		is difficult to run it on the latest computers. <i>Exult</i> is a
		project to create an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern
		operating systems, capable of using the data and graphics files
		that come with the game.
