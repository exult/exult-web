		As computers evolve, we risk losing classic games from
		the not-so-distant past.  One of these, Ultima VII, a two part RPG from the
		early 1990's, still has a huge following, and many consider it to
		be one of the most immersive games ever produced.  <i>Exult</i> is a
		project to recreate Ultima VII for modern
		operating systems, using the game's original plot, data, and graphics files.
