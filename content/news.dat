	<td>There has been a change in Exult's audio configuration
	between 1.1beta3 and 1.1.9rc1 that is worth mentioning here.
	If you want to use digital music (.ogg files), you now need to
	enable that as follows: while in-game, press <b>escape</b> and
	go to the <b>Audio Options</b> menu. There, set
	the <b>driver</b> option to <b>Digital</b>.
