        Allthough news are a little slow at the moment we are still alive!
        <ul>
        <li>Jeffrey Hoeksma wrote an in depth guide on how to use Exult Studio and Dominus merged it with 
        	the existing documentation. Even though it is still not a complete guide it is already quite
        	useful and a good informative read. Thanks Jeffrey!
        <li>We added a letter page that contains some of the praise we received from users and Lord British himself.
        <li>Dr.Code fixed some bugs in Exult (selling baked bread, another trial bug in SI) and Exult Studio.

        Development is proceeding quite slowly, but we're still fixing bugs.
        Remember some of the things mentioned here are happening on the development 1.1 branch
        whereas the 1.0 is only for bugfixes.
        <ul>
        <li>More progress on the Zaurus port (MIDI support, also thanks to Colourless' port of the FMOPL driver)
        <li>Weather shows when gumps are open
        <li>Bug fixes

        Artaxerxes is making a lot of progress with the Zaurus port. The latest version supports sound!
        <ul>
        <li>Explosions inside containers should now properly work
        <li>Fixes to sleeping (you should now lie down in the right bed)
        <li>Various combat-related bugfixes (slimes, party-members not attacking)
        <li>Some cosmetic fixes to conversations

	Artaxerxes is currently porting Exult to the Zaurus! Take a look at the <A HREF="screenshots_zaurus.php">screenshots</A>. You can also download the current version of the page from our <A HREF="download.php">download page</A> (under 1.1.x snapshots)
	<ul>
	<li>Fixed a pathfinding bug in Windows and MacOS that caused trouble with finding paths across staircases. (e.g., Training in Monitor)
	<li>Fixed a bug that caused the camera to lose the avatar when going through moongates
	<li>Several other bugfixes

	We've been fixing lots of bugs in the 1.0.x snapshots the last month: <ul>
	<li>Fixed several combat-related bugs
	<li>Finished adding special object names for Serpent Isle
	<li>The --buildmap command line option is working again
	<li>Fixed a crash that could occur whenever you're near Spektran (SI)
	<li>People should no longer sleep next to their beds or sit next to their chairs
	<li>Some fixes to paperdolls in BG, and some new art by Oblivious.
	<li>Lots of other minor (and not-so-minor) bugfixes

	If you checked our download page recently, you may have noticed that
	we have two sets of development snapshots now: a 1.0.x (stable)
	snapshot, and a 1.1.x (unstable) snapshot.
	</p><p>
	The 1.0.x branch will become our 1.0 release soon, hopefully, and we
	will mainly be fixing any remaining bugs in this branch. We recommend
	using the 1.0.x snapshots for playing and testing Exult.
	</p><p>
	The 1.1.x branch is meant mostly as a 'developer playground' at the
	moment. We are making some very destabilizing changes to this branch,
	like a rewritten usecode interpreter and new audio code. We do not
	recommend using the 1.1.x snapshots for normal playing.
