	<td><p><b>Exult 1.4.9 RC1 has been released!</b><br/>
	It took us over six years, but with DNF seemingly getting ready to be released after all, we had to do something.
	To prepare for a full release, we have created a first Release Candidate, available on
	our <a href="download.php">download page</a>.
	Please play with it and tell us of any problem you encounter using the
	<a href="forum/index.php">forum</a> or
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2335">bug tracker</a>.</p>

	<p>If you have followed the news this list is likely already familiar to you,
	but we did a lot with Exult in the years since 1.2:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Compatible with the stricter permissions of Windows Vista and Windows 7</li>
	<li>Rewrite of the Graphics system to allow switching to full screen on modern systems</li>
	<li>Better integration into Mac OS X with default location for the supported games</li>
	<li>Smooth scrolling (disabled by default, though)</li>
	<li>More data from the original has been decoded and thus improved gameplay and combat</li>
	<li>In-game Notebook with support for automatic notes (notes created by usecode)</li>
	<li>Integrated Pentagram's audio system which means support for real Roland MT-32 device, Roland MT-32 emulation and FluidSynth</li>
	<li>Removed dependency of the audio system on SDL_Mixer</li>
	<li>New shapes for the paperdolls</li>
	<li>Tons of bugfixes</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There have been many changes to Exult Studio and our support for mods as well:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Multi-map support for new games</li>
	<li>Moved hard-coded information to datafiles</li>
	<li>Increased limits on resource sizes (shapes, frames, etc)</li>
	<li>Greatly improved compiler tools to ease new game development</li>
	<li>Tons of work on our map editor Exult Studio and the ability to develop new games and mods</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Worth mentioning is that our team member Marzo has developed two mods, which can be
	<a href="http://www.seventowers.org/downloads.php?section=0">downloaded separately</a>:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Keyring for BG which adds a keyring and a lot of other enhancements</li>
	<li>SIfixes for SI which corrects many mistakes in the game, for example you can now cure Cantra when you play with this mod</li>
	</ul>
