	<p>
	If you checked our download page recently, you may have noticed that
	we have two sets of development snapshots now: a 1.0.x (stable)
	snapshot, and a 1.1.x (unstable) snapshot.
	</p><p>
	The 1.0.x branch will become our 1.0 release soon, hopefully, and we
	will mainly be fixing any remaining bugs in this branch. We recommend
	using the 1.0.x snapshots for playing and testing Exult.
	</p><p>
	The 1.1.x branch is meant mostly as a 'developer playground' at the
	moment. We are making some very destabilizing changes to this branch,
	like a rewritten usecode interpreter and new audio code. We do not
	recommend using the 1.1.x snapshots for normal playing.
