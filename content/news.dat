	<td><b>Exult 1.1.10rc2 has been released!</b><br>
	This is mainly a bugfix release. We have fixed a number of
	potentially plot-stopping crash bugs and additionally resolved
	some Windows-only bugs, including a problem with resurrection.
	Sources and Fedora Core and Windows binary packages are	currently
	available for <a href="download.php">download</a>.
	Expect binaries for other platforms soon.<br>
	Note that the 1.1.10rc2 hasn't propagated to all the SourceForge
	download mirrors yet, so you may have to try a few mirrors.<br>
	<b>Update:</b> A Mac OS X 10.3 binary has also been released.

	<td>There has been a change in Exult's audio configuration
	between 1.1beta3 and 1.1.9rc1 that is worth mentioning here.
	If you want to use digital music (.ogg files), you now need to
	enable that as follows: while in-game, press <b>escape</b> and
	go to the <b>Audio Options</b> menu. There, set
	the <b>driver</b> option to <b>Digital</b>.
