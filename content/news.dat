	<td><p><b><u>Ultima VII turns 30 - Exult releases version 1.8</u></b><br/></p>
	<p>30 years ago Origin released Ultima VII - The Black Gate and many still
	hold this game in a very high regard. We certainly do!<br/>
	Instead of waiting another decade this is the perfect opportunity to release 
	our next version. Because of the measures we took to eliminate weird crashes 
	it was important to make a new release available.</br>
	By default we will now play the extended intro of Serpent Isle, that we restored 
	from an old recording of it. It was cut and slimmed down for the release of 
	Ultima VII's Part 2 to conserve precious floppy disk space. A shout out to 
	Denis Loubet for creating this masterpiece.</br>
	Two important things were always missing from Exult in regards to the Black 
	Gate:</br>
	The sound effects in the intro and the congratulations screen! Both are now 
	present!</br>
	Currently we are in the process of merging Ken Cecka's fork of Exult for 
	<b>Android</b> (*). While this is not yet finished, Ken created a 1.8 version 
	based on our release code.</br>
	
	You can find the Android, Windows and macOS releases on our 
	<a href="download.php">download page</a> (**).</br>
	Please play with it and tell us of any problem you encounter using the
	<a href="forum/index.php">forum</a> or
	<a href="https://github.com/exult/exult/issues">bug tracker</a>.</p>

	<p>A brief list of the most important changes in Exult since v1.6:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Windows builds are by default 64bit</li>
	<li>Exult Studio modernized by porting it to GTK+ 3 (thanks Dragon Baroque)</li>
	<li>Exult Studio now offered as a download for macOS</li>
	<li>Exult shows the proper ending screen for BG (you have beaten Ultima VII in nn days...)</li>
	<li>Sound effects in the BG intro were missing</li>
	<li>Extended intro for SI implemented</li>
	<li>More crashes eliminated caused by cached out objects</li>
	<li>"Gumps pause game" no longer delays usecode events</li>
	<li>Smooth virtual joystick movement on iOS</li>
	<li>iOS shows the mouse cursor when a real mouse device is used</li>

	<li>Updated Windows installer to download and install the audio packs and our mods</li>
	<li>Our options have been reordered</li>
	</ul>

	<p>But we do have known issues:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Antimagic rain caused by the cube generator is still not dissipating as fast as it should</li>
	<li>Exult does not return to the game menu after beating the game (instead it quits)</li>
	<li>Some schedules need more detailed love</li>
	<li>Several bugs that need more in-depth looking at but no plot-stopping bugs</li>
	</ul>

	<td><p><b><u>Exult 1.6 has been released to celebrate Ultima VII's 28th birthday!</u></b><br/></p>
	<p>Almost ten years after the version 1.4.9rc1, 16 years after the last stable version (v1.2) and 
	28 years after the official release of Ultima VII - The Black Gate (16 April 1992), we are finally 
	ready to release a new version. With many developers busy with their real life and most having moved on, 
	it took us this long. We have been busy squashing more of the inexplicable crashes but these changes 
	will force us to stop supporting some ancient operating systems.</br>
	That's why we decided to release one last version of Exult, Exult Studio and Exult's tools for the old OS' 
	before moving on with development. For really old Windows operating systems (95/98/ME/NT/2000) we prepared 
	a legacy download.<br/>
	So please grab the new version available on our <a href="download.php">download page</a>.</br>
	Please play with it and tell us of any problem you encounter using the
	<a href="forum/index.php">forum</a> or
	<a href="https://github.com/exult/exult/issues">bug tracker</a>.</p>
