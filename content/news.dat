	<td><p<b>Exult 1.4.9 RC1 has been released!</b><br/>
	It took us over six years but with DNF seemingly getting ready to be released after all, we had to do something.
	So here we go, please play with our RC1 and tell us of any problem you encounter.<br/>
	And please do it quickly, so we beat DNF!<br/
	Although rehashing some old news, we did a lot of stuff with Exult in the last six years:
	<ul>
	<li>Compatible with the stricter permissions of Windows Vista and Windows 7</li>
	<li>Rewrite of the Graphics system to allow switching to full screen on modern systems</li>
	<li>Better integration into Mac OS X with default location for the supported games</li>
	<li>Smooth scrolling (disabled by default, though)</li>
	<li>More data from the original has been decoded and thus improved gameplay and combat</li>
	<li>Two mods developed by our team member Marzo, Keyring for BG which adds a keyring and a lot of other enhancements
		and SIfixes for SI which corrects many mistakes in the game, for example you can now cure Cantra when you play with this mod</li>
	<li>In-game Notebook with support for automatic notes (notes created by usecode)</li>
	<li>Integrated Pentagram(tm) Audio system which means support for Real Roland MT32 device, Roland MT32 Emulation and Fluidsynth</li>
	<li>Removed dependency of the Audio system on SDL_Mixer</li>
	<li>New shapes for paperdoll</li>
	<li>Multi-map support for new games</li>
	<li>Increased limits on resource sizes (shapes, frames, etc)</li>
	<li>Moved hard-coded information to datafiles</li>
	<li>Greatly improved compiler tools to ease new game development</li>
	<li>Tons of work on our map editor Exult Studio and the ability to develop new games and mods</li>
	<li>Tons of bugfixes</li>
	</ul>
