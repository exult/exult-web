	<td><b>Fixed binary for OS X available</b><br>
	The Mac OS X binary for Exult 0.98rc1 had some issues related to
	mouse movement and full screen mode, caused by the version of SDL used
	to create it. We just released a new
	<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/exult/exult-0.98rc1a.dmg">updated
	binary</a> which hopefully fixes these issues. If you still encounter
	problems, please report them at our
