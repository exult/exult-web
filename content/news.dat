	<td><p><b><u>Exult 1.6 has been released to celebrate Ultima VII's 28th birthday!</u></b><br/></p>
	<p>Almost ten years after the version 1.4.9rc1, 16 years after the last stable version (v1.2) and 
	28 years after the official release of Ultima VII - The Black Gate (16 April 1992), we are finally 
	ready to release a new version. With many developers busy with their real life and most having moved on, 
	it took us this long. We have been busy squashing more of the inexplicable crashes but these changes 
	will force us to stop supporting some ancient operating systems.</br>
	That's why we decided to release one last version of Exult, Exult Studio and Exult's tools for the old OS' 
	before moving on with development. For really old Windows operating systems (95/98/ME/NT/2000) we prepared 
	a legacy download.<br/>
	So please grab the new version available on our <a href="download.php">download page</a>.</br>
	Please play with it and tell us of any problem you encounter using the
	<a href="forum/index.php">forum</a> or
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/exult/bugs/">bug tracker</a>.</p>

	<p>A brief list of the most important changes in Exult since v1.4.9rc1:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Shortcut bar with important shortcuts right on top of the screen (thanks Litchie)</li>
	<li>Switch to SDL2 - important for up to date OS'</li>
	<li>NxBR and HQ3x/HQ4x scalers</li>
	<li>Option to drop stacks of items without confirmation</li>
	<li>Some more combat options to make charmed combat more difficult</li>

	<li>Serpent Isle Beta version works</li>
