	<td><b>What happens next?</b><br>
	After the successful 1.2 release we are now going to make fundamental 
	changes to Exult that will make snapshots a lot more unstable for the 
	coming weeks/months. This time we really mean unstable, don't expect 
	to be able to play through the games with coming snapshots. For playing 
	please use the official release.<br>
	The changes will include:<br>
	<ul>	
	<li>recent snapshots have the version number 1.4.x (it seems we skipped 1.3)</li>
	<li>combat uses dexterity to determine how fast you can strike</li>
	<li>wand charges are kept track of</li>
	<li>rewrite of the midi & graphics system to make it easier to manage</li>
	<li>multimap support</li>
	<li>enhanced savegames so we can use more than 1024 shapes 
	(this might even break old savegames)</li>
	<li>other changes intended to make developing of new games easier</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	Some members of Exult are also busy with <a href="http://pentagram.sf.net">Pentagram</a>,
	a project aiming to create an Ultima 8 engine for use on modern operating systems. 
	They polished up their homepage to be a bit more informative. Have a look.<br>

	This is mainly a bugfix release. We have fixed a number of
	potentially plot-stopping crash bugs and additionally resolved
	some Windows-only bugs, including a problem with resurrection.
	Sources and Fedora Core and Windows binary packages are	currently
	available for <a href="download.php">download</a>.
	Expect binaries for other platforms soon.<br>
	Note that the 1.1.10rc2 hasn't propagated to all the SourceForge
	download mirrors yet, so you may have to try a few mirrors.<br>
	<b>Update:</b> A Mac OS X 10.3 binary has also been released.

	<td>There has been a change in Exult's audio configuration
	between 1.1beta3 and 1.1.9rc1 that is worth mentioning here.
	If you want to use digital music (.ogg files), you now need to
	enable that as follows: while in-game, press <b>escape</b> and
	go to the <b>Audio Options</b> menu. There, set
	the <b>driver</b> option to <b>Digital</b>.
