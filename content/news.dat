	<td><b>What happens next?</b><br>
	After the successful 1.2 release we are now going to make fundamental 
	changes to Exult that will make snapshots a lot more unstable for the 
	coming weeks/months. This time we really mean unstable, don't expect 
	to be able to play through the games with coming snapshots. For playing 
	please use the official release.<br>
	The changes will include:<br>
	<ul>	
	<li>recent snapshots have the version number 1.4.x (it seems we skipped 1.3)</li>
	<li>combat uses dexterity to determine how fast you can strike</li>
	<li>wand charges are kept track of</li>
	<li>rewrite of the midi & graphics system to make it easier to manage</li>
	<li>multimap support</li>
	<li>enhanced savegames so we can use more than 1024 shapes 
	(this might even break old savegames)</li>
	<li>other changes intended to make developing of new games easier</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	Some members of Exult are also busy with <a href="http://pentagram.sf.net">Pentagram</a>,
	a project aiming to create an Ultima 8 engine for use on modern operating systems. 
	They polished up their homepage to be a bit more informative. Have a look.<br>
