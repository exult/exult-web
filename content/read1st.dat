<p>After more than four years since the first release by Jeff in September
1998, Exult has finally reached a level of maturity and playbility which
we believe warrants its release as an 1.0 version.<br />
What does the Exult Team mean by 1.0 ? We mean that you can play both
"Ultima VII: The Black Gate" and "Ultima VII part 2: Serpent Isle" together
with their respective add-ons "Forge of Virtue" and "Silver Seed" from
beginning to end, with no plot holes. This does not mean the experience 
is perfect: we are not aiming for a precise replica of the originals
(use a low-end 486 with DOS 5.0, a SoundBlaster and a Roland MT-32 for
that). There are many things where Exult behaves differently (party
formation, combat, stealing, etc.) but we don't think these detract from
the fun and enjoyment of playing these great games. We've done our best
to add improvements which we believe add to the game, and give it a more
modern feel. Most of these can be disabled and enabled at will.</p>
<p>During the Beta phase, no new features have been added to Exult and we worked 
exclusively on stabilization and documentation. Now that we are satisfied 
with stability on all platforms, we are releasing Exult 1.0. Exult development
is currently branched in two: a stable branch, to which only bugfixes are 
applied, and from which subsequent 1.0.x releases will be made, and a 
development 1.1.x branch which focuses on new features and especially on 
getting ExultStudio and the other tools working. The differences between the 
two branches is listed further down this file in the Appendix. </p>
<p>If you have used Exult before, you should really start new games for both 
BG and SI as previous versions may have generated incorrect savegames. If 
you experience problems with old savegames, you are on your own.</p>
<p><b>Please read the documentation and the FAQ very carefully before
reporting problems with Exult.</b></p>
<p>If you want to report bugs, use the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=102335&group_id=2335&func=browse">bug tracker</a>
on our SourceForge project page.<br />
Provide a good description of the bug, a way to reproduce it, a savegame
immediately before triggering the bug, and a description of your
computer's configuration (OS, CPU, soundcard, videocard). Remember:
Exult runs on many platforms, not just yours.
As usual, we are available on our <a href="http://exult.sourceforge.net/forum/list.php?f=1">forum</a> and 
on IRC (#exult on irc.openprojects.net) and we will try to help as much as we can.</p>
<p>Have fun!<br />
