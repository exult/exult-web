<p><i>Exult</i> is being developed in C++ under Linux, MacOS and Windows using the SDL library to make porting to other platforms relatively easy. Source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/exult">on GitHub</a>.</p> 
<p>The current version is fully playable. This, and further development, is only possible due to the work done by other fans who have decoded the various Ultima VII data files, especially Gary Thompson, Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Schonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag.</p>
<p><i>Exult</i> aims to make the two Ultima VII games playable on modern hardware, in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing) its original splendor as is possible. You need to <em>own</em> either Ultima VII: The Black Gate or Ultima VII - Part 2: Serpent Isle in order to use <i>Exult</i>, and we encourage you to buy a legal copy (you can buy them online from GOG.com or EA's Origin).</p>
<p>None of the people involved are affiliated with Electronic Arts in any way, nor is EA responsible for, or even aware of, this work. Do not contact them about anything to do with <i>Exult</i>.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You need to own a copy of Ultima VII to run <i>Exult</i>.</p>
