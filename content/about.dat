<p><a href="mailto:jsf@users.sourceforge.net">Jeff S. Freedman</a>, aka &quot;DrCode&quot;, a software developer living in Portland, Oregon, started Exult sometime in the last century so he could learn to display graphics in X-windows.  His hobbies include snowboarding, camping, and (of course) writing Free Software.  He grew up in Los Angeles, is a bit on the older side (but immaturity keeps a person young), and is married-with-children.  Previous accomplishments include a Math PhD from UCLA, several car-rallies produced in LA, and a children's book, "The Magic Dishpan of Oz" (and I get 40 cents if you buy a copy:-)).</p>

He is also one of the developers of Pentagram (&quot;Exult for Ultima 8&quot;)</p>
<p><a href="mailto:nadir@users.sourceforge.net">Tristan Tarrant</a> aka &quot;Nadir&quot;, born in Bristol, UK in 1973. He has lived most of his life in Italy (since he was 6 weeks old!!!). He has a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK and an MSc in Parallel Architectures at the University of Edinburgh, UK.
He is now married to Patrizia and lives on Lake Como. He is a long-time Linux user (since kernel 0.99.13 with an SLS distribution) and an Open Source advocate.
One of the first to contribute to Jeff's "X-windows Ultima7 map browser", he's done the intro, the ending, the menus, the GIMP plugin, the FLEX packer and some work on ExultStudio.
Nowadays he doesn't have much time to contribute code, although he still reads the forum and commits the occasional bugfix from time to time.</p>

He has been mostly self-taught, since the time he began pecking away at a keyboard at the ripe age of 5 years old.  Some of Phillip's working knowledge includes game development, GBA development, C/C++, networking, Linux, Windows, and DOS.  He apparently also has some skills in PocketPC, as he recently (June 2007) updated the PocketPC port of Exult to be able to run and currently maintains it, with plenty of good direction from other Exult users and other Exult developers.</p>
