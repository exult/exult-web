<blockquote>Just so that you know.
On a personal level I am very excited to see you doing this.
Its tough to see games fade out, when the computers or operating systems
required to play them go away.

<blockquote>I've been following Exult development since just before version
.20 and I must say it's amazing how well everyone is working together
considering how impromptu it is. Exult seems to have turned into a (to me)
a model for "Open Source, Done Right"

I have just recently downloaded your exult program and am currently enjoying
the replay of one of my favourite games on a dual processor Dell server
running Windows 2000 (the first time I played the game it was barely running
on a 386sx).
<br/>
You guys have done an AWESOME job. The amount of effort that it took to do
this is astounding. I salute the passion it takes to put it in so much
effort in an obsolete game.
<br/>
The entire Exult team rocks...

I'm a player of U7 in Taiwan, R.O.C. I don't know how to express my
appreciation to you! Thank you so much for your modifiability of U7, it
really brings my memories of U7 back.

I would just like to give a big thanks to the entire Exult team
for building such a great game engine! I can't think of any other project
that has actually pulled it off other than Exult!

<p><b>From W.S.:</b></p>
<blockquote>
Just wanted to place myself in with undoubtedly countless others to express
my gratitude and appreciation for the work your team has put into this project.

I have to thank you and the rest of your team for the excellent work you have
done with the Exult engine... For about 5 years now, I was hoping that someone
would do this. Low and behold I find yours on Friday and I am amazed! U7 was
my first RPG on my first computer back in '92 (let alone my first computer
game). What a nightmare getting that to run!! damn voodoo memory
management.. plus I had Stacker running on a 100MB harddrive and a 486
33. Today I'm running it on a 40GB harddrive and an Athlon Thunderbird
800. What a difference 8 years makes! The game brings back so many
memories. Thanks again!
