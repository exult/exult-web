Just so that you know.
On a personal level I am very excited to see you doing this.
Its tough to see games fade out, when the computers or operating systems
required to play them go away.

I've been following Exult development since just before version .20 and I must say it's amazing how well everyone is working together considering how impromptu it is.  Exult seems to have turned into a (to me) a model for "Open Source, Done Right"

I have just recently downloaded your exult program and am currently enjoying 
the replay of one of my favourite games on a dual processor Dell server 
running Windows 2000 (the first time I played the game it was barely running 
on a 386sx).
<br>
You guys have done an AWESOME job. The amount of effort that it took to do 
this is astounding. I salute the passion it takes to put it in so much 
effort in an obsolete game.
<br>
The entire Exult team rocks...

I'm a player of U7 in Taiwan, R.O.C. I don't know how to express my
appreciation to you! Thank you so much for your modifiability of U7, it
really brings my memories of U7 back.

I would just like to give a big thanks to the entire Exult team
for building such a great game engine! I can't think of any other project
that has actually pulled it off other than Exult!

<p><b>From W.S.:</b></p>
<ul>
Just wanted to place myself in with undoubtedly countless others to express
my gratitude and appreciation for the work your team has put into this project.

I have to thank you and the rest of your team for the excellent work you have
done with the Exult engine...  For about 5 years now, I was hoping that someone
would do this.  Low and behold I find yours on Friday and I am amazed!  U7 was
my first RPG on my first computer back in '92 (let alone my first computer
game).  What a nightmare getting that to run!!  damn voodoo memory
management.. plus I had Stacker running on a 100MB harddrive and a 486
33.  Today I'm running it on a 40GB harddrive and an Athlon Thunderbird
800.  What a difference 8 years makes!  The game brings back so many
memories.  Thanks again!
