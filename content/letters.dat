Just so that you know.
On a personal level I am very excited to see you doing this.
Its tough to see games fade out, when the computers or operating systems
required to play them go away.

I've been following Exult development since just before version .20 and I must say it's amazing how well everyone is working together considering how impromptu it is.  Exult seems to have turned into a (to me) a model for "Open Source, Done Right"

I have to thank you and the rest of your team for the excellent work you have
done with the Exult engine...  For about 5 years now, I was hoping that someone
would do this.  Low and behold I find yours on Friday and I am amazed!  U7 was
my first RPG on my first computer back in '92 (let alone my first computer
game).  What a nightmare getting that to run!!  damn voodoo memory
management.. plus I had Stacker running on a 100MB harddrive and a 486
33.  Today I'm running it on a 40GB harddrive and an Athlon Thunderbird
800.  What a difference 8 years makes!  The game brings back so many
memories.  Thanks again!
