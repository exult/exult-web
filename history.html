								<p><b><u>State of Exult or why there is still no new version</u></b></p>
								<p>It's been 3 1/2 years since the release candidate and almost a decade since
									our last full release. Duke Nukem Forever was released since then. Imagine that.<br />
									So why is there still no new release of Exult?<br />
									After the 1.2 release Exult went into experimental mode, mostly making it easier and
									more stable to mod the original games via Exult Studio. Along with that many lingering
									issues, missing features and unknown data files from the original got implemented. In
									turn that broke other things in Exult and for a long time, Exult was just too unstable
									to be released. When development slowed down we fixed a lot of stuff and released
									1.4.9rc1 - making it a release candidate on purpose. It generated enough interest for
									people to play Exult again and send us their bug reports and there were a lot. Some even
									game breaking and when the disappearing objects bug was discovered it proved we were correct
									in not labeling the release a full release. Since that bug has been squished the 1.4.9rc1
									is no longer linked to on our site to prevent people using that and run into that severe bug.<br />
									And now we seem to be in a situation that everytime we think Exult could be ready for a new
									release, some new bug is discovered that prevents us from releasing.</p>
								<p>This time the big bad bug is a flaw in which we handle game eggs
									(see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/exult/bugs/1875/">Bug #1875</a> ). Mostly you will
									not notice that something is wrong until you reach to the abandoned outpost in SI and get
									slaughtered by the misbehaving fire shooter/energy barrier trap room
									(see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/exult/bugs/1848/">Bug #1848</a> - savegame included)
									or when you notice that the anti magic rain in BG never stops until you restart Exult or whatever
									(see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/exult/bugs/1865/">Bug #1865</a>).<br />
									Whenever this is fixed you can expect another round of bug reports coming in about all the
									things now broken...<br />
									(not to mention countless other stuff, including some bug in the way we handle midi music,
									some BG intro things etc...)</p>
								<p><b>Whenever</b> - because development of Exult is currently not really existing, it hasn't
									for a while and doesn't look like it is picking up soon. There have been small bursts of bug
									fixing, mostly by Marzo, Willem and Malignant Manor but these are getting fewer and fewer.<br />
									Exult is now almost 16 years old and a lot of the developers have been with it since then.
									Lives and interests change and it's hard to keep interested in something like Exult that at
									times is easier to break than to fix.</p>
								<p>So, is Exult dead? No, but it's not teeming with life and as has been written before, without
									new developers Exult might never leave this state.<br />
									Don't mistake this for a farewell, we just want to be frank about these things.</p>

								<p><b><u>Disappearing objects fixed but still no new version.</u></b></p>
								<p>Dr. Code has fixed the disappearing objects and the resulting crashes quite some time ago (August 2012)
									and at the time it seemed we could fast forward to a new release. Unfortunately some other crashes were
									uncovered and Marzo went on a bug squishing rampage last year. After that very productive outburst our
									development almost completely stopped apart from some bug fixes.</p>
								<p>On the plus side this means that the current snapshots are much more stable than the last rc1 release,
									not to mention the ancient 1.2 version that should never be used again. For that reason we no longer link
									to our old releases on our download page.<br />
									However there is still no new release and thus the ancient Exult 1.2 version is unfortunately still widely
									regarded as the stable version, especially in Linux repositories.</p>

								<p><u>What we've been up to since the rc1 release and why there is no final version yet.</u></p>
								<p>Let's start off with the the bad news:<br />
									We have a bug that causes random objects in the games to disappear forever. When this happens
									Exult tends to crash badly. Unfortunately this bug is unpredictable and we have no sure way of
									reproducing and thus fixing it. We have some ideas of what is happening but no fix yet. This is
									a real show stopper and unless we fix it we can't release another release candidate or a final
									version. If you encounter this bug (disappearing objects, random crashes, especially in combat)
									best you can do is revert to an earlier savegame.</p>
								<p>The good news is that we welcome a new member to our team, Malignant Manor, a long time user
									of Exult.<br />
									He took on many bugs and improved many other things:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>command line option for portable use of Exult and Exult Studio for Windows</li>
									<li>fixed many NPC schedules (baking, serving food, eating food, ...)</li>
									<li>fixed talking to NPCs through locked doors (important for the Fawn trial)</li>
									<li>added a new combat option to make handling of charmed party members more realistic (and thus
										harder) and also fixed normal charmed behavior in some places</li>
									<li>added many options to the game menu that you could only change through editing the cfg file</li>
									<li>fixed some Silver Seed stairs teleporters</li>
									<li>possible to have separate settings for fullscreen and windowed mode</li>
									<li>fixed various things for new games created with Exult Studio</li>
									<li>and many other things...</li>
								</ul>
								<p>We also put all our various audio files (digital music pack and the SFX packs) into an
									all-in-one package. You can download a zip file for manual installation or an installer for either
									Windows or Mac OS X. You don't need to download this if you already downloaded the audio packs
									individually before. And if you still prefer to download the smaller, individual packs, these are
									also still available.<br />
									Head to our <a href="download.html">download page</a> to grab it.</p>

								<p><b><u>Exult 1.4.9rc1 has been released!</u></b><br />
									It took us over six years, but with DNF seemingly getting ready to be released after all, we had to do
									something.
									To prepare for a full release, we have created a first Release Candidate, available on
									our <a href="download.html">download page</a>.
									Please play with it and tell us of any problem you encounter using the
									forum or
									<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/exult/bugs/">bug tracker</a>.</p>

								<p>If you have followed the news this list is likely already familiar to you,
									but we did a lot with Exult in the years since 1.2:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Compatible with the stricter permissions of Windows Vista and Windows 7</li>
									<li>Rewrite of the Graphics system to allow switching to full screen on modern systems</li>
									<li>Better integration into Mac OS X with default location for the supported games</li>
									<li>Smooth scrolling (disabled by default, though)</li>
									<li>Aspect correction is now supported</li>
									<li>More data from the original has been decoded and thus improved gameplay and combat</li>
									<li>In-game Notebook with support for automatic notes (notes created by usecode)</li>
									<li>Integrated Pentagram's audio system which means support for real Roland MT-32 device, Roland MT-32
										emulation and FluidSynth</li>
									<li>Removed dependency of the audio system on SDL_Mixer</li>
									<li>New shapes for the paperdolls</li>
									<li>Tons of bugfixes</li>
								</ul>

								<p>There have been many changes to Exult Studio and our support for mods as well:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Multi-map support for new games</li>
									<li>Moved hard-coded information to datafiles</li>
									<li>Increased limits on resource sizes (shapes, frames, etc)</li>
									<li>Greatly improved compiler tools to ease new game development</li>
									<li>Tons of work on our map editor Exult Studio and the ability to develop new games and mods</li>
								</ul>

								<p>Worth mentioning is that our team member Marzo has developed two mods, which can be
									<a href="http://www.seventowers.org/downloads.php?section=0">downloaded separately</a>:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Keyring for BG which adds a large quest to obtain a SI-style keyring, as well as a lot of other
										enhancements such as meditating in the shrines and viewing the Codex</li>
									<li>SIfixes for SI which corrects many mistakes in the game, for example you can now cure Cantra when you
										play with this mod</li>

								<p><b><u>What happens next?</u></b><br />
									After the successful 1.2 release we are now going to make fundamental
									changes to Exult that will make snapshots a lot more unstable for the
									coming weeks/months. This time we really mean unstable, don't expect
									to be able to play through the games with coming snapshots. For playing
									please use the official release.<br />
									The changes will include:<br />
								<ul>
									<li>recent snapshots have the version number 1.4.x (it seems we skipped 1.3)</li>
									<li>combat uses dexterity to determine how fast you can strike</li>
									<li>wand charges are kept track of</li>
									<li>rewrite of the midi & graphics system to make it easier to manage</li>
									<li>multimap support</li>
									<li>enhanced savegames so we can use more than 1024 shapes
										(this might even break old savegames)</li>
									<li>other changes intended to make developing of new games easier</li>
								</ul>
								<br />
								Some members of Exult are also busy with <a href="http://pentagram.sf.net">Pentagram</a>,
								a project aiming to create an Ultima VIII engine for use on modern operating systems.
								They polished up their homepage to be a bit more informative. Have a look.<br />

									If you checked our download page recently, you may have noticed that

									snapshot, and a 1.1.x (unstable) snapshot.
								</p>
								<p>
									The 1.0.x branch will become our 1.0 release soon, hopefully, and we
									will mainly be fixing any remaining bugs in this branch. We recommend
									using the 1.0.x snapshots for playing and testing Exult.
								</p>
								<p>
									The 1.1.x branch is meant mostly as a 'developer playground' at the
									moment. We are making some very destabilizing changes to this branch,
									like a rewritten usecode interpreter and new audio code. We do not
									recommend using the 1.1.x snapshots for normal playing.

								Exult alpha 3 was reviewed by the German game magazine GameStar in
								the june 2001 issue! Translation from German (by Alexander Wetzlmaier):
								<blockquote>
									Ultima VII still belongs to the best role-playing games. It's because
									of the many interaction possibilities and its epic story. However,
									as a DOS program with a very exotic memory manager and missing
									speed adustment, the game doesn't run on modern PCs. Fans are now
									working on a new game engine for Windows. In the current Alpha 3
									version the first part, The Black Gate, already runs better than in
									the original because many bugs were removed. Warren Spector's
									Ultima VII - Part 2: Serpent Isle still causes the programmers problems,
									though.
								</blockquote>
								They rated it 1.8 on a scale from 1 (best) to 5 (worst)!

									glitches in my rendering algorithm.:-(</p>
