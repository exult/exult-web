					<p>
						The Exult Team would like to announce that as of April 1st 2002 an agreement has been reached with
						Electronic Arts to allow development on Exult. The agreement will have Electronic Arts distribute
						and support Exult. All further development of Exult will be funded by Electronic Arts.
					</p>
					<p>
						Effective immediately, further development of Exult will not be open sourced. Additionally, no
						further work on Exult Studio will be released to the public. The Exult Team will be working with
						Electronic Arts on three projects.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first project is to produce a combined version of The Black Gate and Serpent Isle. Called "The
						Complete Ultima VII", it will contain all data files required to play it, including some new bonus
						material (e.g. full length intro movie for Serpent Isle).
					</p>
					<p>
						The second project is to produce an online multiplayer version of Exult for play over the internet.
						Exult Online as it will be called, will require original copies of Ultima VII: The Black Gate and
						Ultima VII - Part II: Serpent Isle to be able to play. It's possible that a version working together
						with "The Complete Ultima VII" will be made as well, though nothing is fixed yet.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, work has begun to port Exult to support other Ultima games. Ultima V and VI are well under
						way, the latter already being completable, though with some occasional glitches. Work on Ultima VIII
						and IV just has begun. There are currently no plans to work on Ultima I-III, Ultima Underworld I &
						II or Ultima IX.
					</p>
					<p>
						All three project should be complete roughly in one year, on April 1st 2003. They will be
						purchaseable via Internet as downloads, or boxed in all stores selling Electronic Arts games.
					</p>
					<p>
						To our fans, we wouldn't have been able to do this without you! If you like to tell us your thoughts
						about these cool new projects, email to <a href="mailto:exult-general@lists.sourceforge.net">our
							mailing list</a>.
